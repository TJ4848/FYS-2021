Short Introduction:
This project implements Logistic Regression using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) to distinguish between two music genres: Pop and Classical. The dataset includes features such as liveness and loudness, which are utilized to train the model and make genre predictions for songs. This project was completed as part of the FYS-2021 course at UIT.
